I'm finally starting a blog at the young age of 44. Mostly I want to share my
thoughts on various topics for the purpose of making it available for my son.
Who knows how long I will be around and based on my own experience,  It doesn't
matter how much you communicate, there are still things left unsaid.

Hopefully there is no need for him to read this blog, but if there is,
it will be here.

I will also blog about tech, opensource, and other topics of interest to me,
perhaps others will find some of it useful.

The sourcecode for this blog is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/mkrakowitzer/blog).

It's built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the docsy theme and hosted using
GitHub pages.
